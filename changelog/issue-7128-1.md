Generic Worker / D2G partial bug fix: support has been improved for running Docker Worker tasks with caches under Generic Worker. Previously, caches from a Docker Worker task running under Generic Worker containing files owned by a user other than root would not be owned by the same (container) user when the cache was mounted in a future task. D2G now consistently maps container uids and gids to host subuids and subgids (when caches are used) in order that cache file ownership, as seen from inside the container, is maintained across task runs. However, this fix does not apply when the privileged capability is enabled in the Docker Worker payload, since privileged tasks are executed under docker rather than podman. This fix only applies when podman is used.
