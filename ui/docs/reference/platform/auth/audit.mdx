# Audit History

Taskcluster provides an audit history feature that tracks changes made to key entities in the system, including clients, roles, secrets and hooks.
This helps administrators monitor and review changes for security and compliance purposes.

## Tracked Actions

The audit history records the following types of actions:

### Clients
- Client creation
- Client updates
- Client deletion
- Client enabled/disabled
- Access token resets

### Roles
- Role creation
- Role updates
- Role deletion

### Secrets
- Secret creation
- Secret updates
- Secret deletion

### Hooks
- Hook creation
- Hook updates
- Hook deletion

### Worker manager
- Worker pool creation
- Worker pool updates
- Worker pool deletion

## Accessing Audit History

You can retrieve the audit history for an entity using the Auth service's `getEntityHistory` API endpoint:

```js
await auth.getEntityHistory(entityType, entityId, [options]);
```

Parameters:
- `entityType`: The type of entity ("client", "role", "secret", or "hook")
- `entityId`: The ID of the specific entity
- `options`: Optional pagination parameters
  - `continuationToken`: Token for paginating through results
  - `limit`: Maximum number of entries to return

The response includes:
- `auditHistory`: Array of audit entries, each containing:
  - `client_id`: The client that performed the action
  - `action_type`: The type of action performed
  - `created`: Timestamp when the action occurred
- `continuationToken`: Token for retrieving the next page of results

## Data Retention

Audit history entries are automatically purged after 30 days by default. This retention period can be configured using the `auditHistoryRetentionDays` setting in the Auth service configuration.

## Required Scopes

To access audit history, you need the scope:
```
auth:audit-history:<entityType>
```

Where `entityType` matches the type of entity you want to query ("client", "role", "secret", or "hook").

## Example Usage

```js
// Get audit history for a client
const history = await auth.getEntityHistory(
  'client',
  'my-client-id'
);

// Get audit history for a role with pagination
const history = await auth.getEntityHistory(
  'role',
  'my-role-id',
  {
    limit: 10,
    continuationToken: '...'
  }
);
```

This provides visibility into who made what changes and when, helping with security audits and troubleshooting.
