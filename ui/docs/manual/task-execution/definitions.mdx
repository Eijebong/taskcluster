There are a number of terms surrounding queues and workers that are named
similarly and can be confusing. This page offers a quick overview and reference
to help disambiguate them.

First, there's a set of closely related things that largely pertain to Worker
Manager, the Queue, and task definitions. They are:

* taskQueueId: A property present on every Task that represents a queue
  of tasks that will be claimed by a `workerPoolId` of the same name.
* workerPoolId & workerPool: A set of workers in Worker Manager. Each worker
  in this set will claim tasks from the `taskQueueId` of the same name.
  Each pool also contains configuration used by Worker Manager.
* provisionerId & workerType: Legacy terms that are subsets of taskQueueId
  and workerPoolId. When present, they can be combined with a "/" to form
  one of the above. Eg: a provisionerId of `mozilla` and workerType of
  `linux` will form a taskQueueId and workerPoolId of `mozilla/linux`.
  These are still used instead of `workerPoolId` by generic-worker.
* workerGroup & workerId: Identifiers for an individual worker. These are
  purely information, and do not relate to any of the above properties
  except by coincidence.
